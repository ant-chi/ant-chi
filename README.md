<h1> Hello World! <img src=assets/sunglasses.gif width="32"/><img src=assets/waving.gif width="32px"> </h1>

<p>Welcome to my Github! I'm Anthony and I recently graduated from UCSD with a double major in data science and economics. I'm currently looking for roles in data science/analytics and have experience developing data driven web apps and wrangling real-world data to gain insights.
 
In my free time I enjoy fixing and repairing bikes 🛠️, watching unhealthy amounts of basketball (Go Celtics! :shamrock:), and playing the guitar :guitar:.


<h4> These are two projects that I'm proud to show off. </h4>
